description: This is a project born out of frustration to the expectation of immediate reaction of instant messaging which results in always having to be connected. It is like a system that I have to conform myself to, but what if that system can conform to me? I wanted to find to make the digital world come to me instead of me having to seek the digital. Also, making people jump through this hoop makes the messages feel more personal
