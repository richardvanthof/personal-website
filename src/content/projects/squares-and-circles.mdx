type: audiovisual
date: '2019'
description: Squares and Circles is a film in which we research and reflect about the absurdity of gender and all the rules we impose upon ourselves. In this film we got the challange to work almoast only with found footage. It resulted in a film in which we used editing as a form of clay with which we can sculpt within the editing room.
