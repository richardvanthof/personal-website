description: When I walk around I often see interesting compositions, I find it really interesting to document these. It just happend that I do not always had a good camera with me, which resulted in me having to take pictures with my phone. These pictures do have some qualitaitve disadvantagess, especially less control. But in another way it feels like the camera is reinterpreting the scene for me. Throughout the years I learnt how to use these in my advantage so I can get a new interpretation.

## Intentionally Uncontrolled
This experimentational and inventive way of thinking became something that influenced my image making strongly. Even when I have more control.
